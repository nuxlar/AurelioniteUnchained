# Aurelionite Unchained

This is basically a vanilla-compatible, less intense, GoldenCoastPlus fight with RiskyMod's Laser rework. Didn't want Aurelionite's fight to be Mithrix level intensity for a pre-phase 5 secret boss so made a lil compromise. 

There are only 4 beacons and Aurelionite spawns vulnerable once all 4 are purchased. Aurelionite's fist attack has 1 larger X pattern and doesn't evolve into an insano-style pattern. The laser is reworked to be more avoidable instead of hide behind something.
